Maximum Audio Abillities for MSM8974 devices (tested on Sony Devices)

This enable 192kHz 24bit audio playback, 24bit audio recording, and higher buffering on kernel for MSM8974 devices

BEFORE SOMEONE COMPLAIN IT DON'T WORK, READ THIS:
It's possible to get it fully work that you have to change some parts on audio HAL (audioflinger) of your system to get it 100% work


To enable it on your kernel you just have to merge the master branch into the root of your kernel repository


It's tested on:
Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Stock and AOSP)
Sony Xperia Z1 (Stock and AOSP)
